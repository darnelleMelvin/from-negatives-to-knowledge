## ðŸ”– Core Vocabularies and Standards

- **SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/)  
  Used to represent controlled vocabularies, including named concepts for people, places, and events.

- **Schema.org**  
  [https://schema.org/](https://schema.org/)  
  A common vocabulary used to describe entities such as people, organizations, events, and locations.

- **AgRelOn (Agent Relationship Ontology)**  
  [https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/agrelon](https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/agrelon)  
  Models social, familial, and professional relationships between agents.

- **GeoNames Ontology**  
  [https://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html](https://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html)  
  A geographical ontology and database that provides identifiers and structured descriptions for cities, regions, and physical features, supporting geographic context in linked data.

 - **RDF 1.1 Primer**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)  
  An introduction to modeling knowledge using RDF triples and serialization formats.

- **RDFS (RDF Schema)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)  
  Provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and relationships between them.

- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/)  
  A formal language for creating ontologies with rich semantics, including class hierarchies and constraints.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Services

- **Wikidata Query Service**  
  [https://query.wikidata.org/](https://query.wikidata.org/)  
  A browser-based interface to test and visualize SPARQL queries using Wikidata's endpoint.

- **DBpedia SPARQL Endpoint**  
  [https://dbpedia.org/sparql](https://dbpedia.org/sparql)  
  A public endpoint to query structured data extracted from Wikipedia.

- **OpenRefine + RDF Extension**  
  [https://openrefine.org/](https://openrefine.org/)  
  Data cleaning and transformation tool with plugins to export to RDF.

- **ProtÃ©gÃ©**  
  [https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://protege.stanford.edu/)  
  Ontology editor for building and navigating OWL and RDF vocabularies.
