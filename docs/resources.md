## ðŸ”– Core Vocabularies and Standards


- **AgRelOn (Agent Relationship Ontology)**  
  [https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/agrelon](https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/agrelon)  
  Models social, familial, and professional relationships between agents.

- **GeoNames Ontology**  
  [https://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html](https://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html)  
  A geographical ontology and database that provides identifiers and structured descriptions for cities, regions, and physical features, supporting geographic context in linked data.

- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/)  
  A formal language for creating ontologies with rich semantics, including class hierarchies and constraints.

- **RDF 1.1 Primer**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)  
  An introduction to modeling knowledge using RDF triples and serialization formats.

- **RDFS (RDF Schema)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)  
  Provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and relationships between them.

- **Schema.org**  
  [https://schema.org/](https://schema.org/)  
  A common vocabulary used to describe entities such as people, organizations, events, and locations.

- **SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/)  
  Used to represent controlled vocabularies, including named concepts for people, places, and events.

- **XSD (XML Schema Definition)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema)  
  Defines data types used in RDF and XML, such as date, integer, and string, for consistent data typing.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Services

- **CSV-2-RDF-Converter:**
  [https://github.com/darnelleMelvin/CSV-2-RDF-Converter](https://github.com/darnelleMelvin/CSV-2-RDF-Converter)  
  A Python script that converts CSV files into RDF triples in the .nt serialization format.
  
- **DBpedia SPARQL Endpoint:**
  [https://dbpedia.org/sparql](https://dbpedia.org/sparql)  
  A public endpoint to query structured data extracted from Wikipedia.
  
- **OpenRefine + RDF Extension:**
  [https://openrefine.org/](https://openrefine.org/)  
  A powerful tool for cleaning and transforming tabular data, including RDF export.
  
- **ProtÃ©gÃ© (OWL Ontology Editor):**
  [https://protege.stanford.edu/](https://protege.stanford.edu/)  
  An open-source platform for building and exploring ontologies in OWL and RDF.
  
- **Wikidata Query Service:**
  [https://query.wikidata.org/](https://query.wikidata.org/)  
  A browser-based interface to write and test SPARQL queries on Wikidata.
