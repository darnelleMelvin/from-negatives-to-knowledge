## ðŸ”– Core Vocabularies and Standards


- **AgRelOn (Agent Relationship Ontology)**  
  [https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/agrelon](https://d-nb.info/standards/elementset/agrelon)  
  Models social, familial, and professional relationships between agents.

- **GeoNames Ontology**  
  [https://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html](https://www.geonames.org/ontology/documentation.html)  
  A geographical ontology and database that provides identifiers and structured descriptions for cities, regions, and physical features, supporting geographic context in linked data.

- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/)  
  A formal language for creating ontologies with rich semantics, including class hierarchies and constraints.

- **RDF 1.1 Primer**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/)  
  An introduction to modeling knowledge using RDF triples and serialization formats.

- **RDF 1.2 Turtle**
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-turtle/](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-turtle/)  
  A compact and readable syntax for writing RDF triples.
  
- **RDFS (RDF Schema)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/)  
  Provides mechanisms for describing groups of related resources and relationships between them.

- **Schema.org**  
  [https://schema.org/](https://schema.org/)  
  A common vocabulary used to describe entities such as people, organizations, events, and locations.

- **SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)**  
  [https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/)  
  Used to represent controlled vocabularies, including named concepts for people, places, and events.
  
- **XSD (XML Schema Definition)**  
  [http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#](https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#)  
  Defines data types used in RDF and XML, such as date, integer, and string, for consistent data typing.
